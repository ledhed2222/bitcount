When I was a very young computer science student I was once asked to write a
program to count the number of '1' bits in a given integer. I couldn't.
I decided I would never be tripped up by this question again. Now, whenever I
learn a new language I write a bitcounting program :)

This is a collection of bitcounting programs I've written in various languages
over the years.

*note* many of these examples were written as an experiment when learning a
new languages, so aren't necessarily the most idiomatic possible solutions.
